1. Project Topic & Goal :
   Analysis is about video game sales data with a focus on the European market . The goal is to solve a real-world data problem by defining a hypothesis.

2. Hypothesis :
  In Europe, PlayStation platforms have been the most dominant. I predict that 'Sports' like FIFA and 'Action' genres like Grand Theft Auto are the highest-selling genres in this region.

3. Data Source :
  Global Video Game Sales (vgsales.csv) - Kaggle and other data repositories. It contains a list of video games with sales broken down by region, including Europe.

4. Web Scraping :
   I scraped Wikipedia for real-time sales data. By merging it with the dataset, I calculated the "Difference" column. The results confirm our data is accurate, validating our analysis.
   Extracted data from : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles
